Healthy lifestyle choices can help you bring your blood sugar level back to normal
*Eat healthy foods.
--------------------
    A diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains and olive oil is associated with a lower risk of prediabetes. Choose foods low in fat and calories and high in fiber. Eat a variety of foods to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition.
*Be more active.
-------------------
     Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up sugar for energy and helps the body use insulin more effectively. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise.
*Lose excess weight.
--------------------
     If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight — about 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms) — can significantly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.
Stop smoking. Stopping smoking can improve the way insulin works, improving your blood sugar level.
*Take medications as needed.
-----------------------------
      If you're at high risk of diabetes, your health care provider might recommend metformin (Glumetza). Medications to control cholesterol and high blood pressure might also be prescribed.
