The glycemic index (GI) is a value used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels.

Foods are classified as low, medium, or high glycemic foods and ranked on a scale of 0–100.

The lower the GI of a specific food, the less it may affect your blood sugar levels

Here are the three GI ratings:

  ->Low: 55 or less
  ->Medium: 56–69
  ->High: 70 or above
