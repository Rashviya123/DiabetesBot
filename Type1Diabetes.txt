In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. As a result, your pancreas stops making insulin. Without insulin, glucose can’t get into your cells and your blood glucose rises above normal. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are serious and usually happen quickly, over a few days to weeks. Symptoms can include

*increased thirst and urination
*increased hunger
*blurred vision
*fatigue
*unexplained weight loss
