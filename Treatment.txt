Type 2 diabetes:
-----------------
It is often treated with diet, exercise, medication taken orally, or with direct infusions of insulin. Oral medications help the insulin the body produces to be more effective in processing glucose. Insulin injected through a syringe or delivered by an insulin pump mimics the way the pancreas would naturally produce and distribute insulin

Type 1 diabetes:
-----------------
If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to take insulin shots (or wear an insulin pump) every day. Insulin is needed to manage your blood sugar levels and give your body energy. You can't take insulin as a pill. That's because the acid in your stomach would destroy it before it could get into your bloodstream.

Gestational diabetes:
---------------------
If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, your treatment plan will depend on your blood sugar levels throughout the day.

In most cases, a doctor will advise you to test your blood sugar before and after meals. They’ll also advise managing your condition by eating a nutrient-rich diet and exercising regularly.

It’s recommended to perform 30 minutes, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise 5 to 7 days per week.

If a doctor encourages you to monitor your blood sugar levels, they may provide you with a glucose-monitoring device.

A doctor may also prescribe insulin injections for you until you give birth. Ask them about properly timing your insulin injections in relation to your meals and exercise to avoid low blood sugar.
