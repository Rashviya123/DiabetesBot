Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. Eat a variety of healthy, fiber-rich foods, which include:

#Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees
#Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower
#Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils
#Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa

The benefits of fiber include:
-----------------------------------
@ Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels
@ Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol
@ Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation
@ Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich
Avoid foods that are "bad carbohydrates" â€” high in sugar with little fiber or nutrients: white bread and pastries, pasta from white flour, fruit juices, and processed foods with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup.

Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."
