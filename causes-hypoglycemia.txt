Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes can include:

Medications. 
---------------
       Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications can cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), used to treat malaria.
Excessive alcohol drinking.
----------------------------
      Drinking heavily without eating can keep the liver from releasing glucose from its glycogen stores into the bloodstream. This can lead to hypoglycemia.
Some critical illnesses. 
-------------------------
      Severe liver illnesses such as severe hepatitis or cirrhosis, severe infection, kidney disease, and advanced heart disease can cause hypoglycemia. Kidney disorders also can keep your body from properly excreting medications. This can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of medications that lower blood sugar levels.
Long-term starvation.
------------------------
        Hypoglycemia can occur with malnutrition and starvation when you don't get enough food, and the glycogen stores your body needs to create glucose are used up. An eating disorder called anorexia nervosa is one example of a condition that can cause hypoglycemia and result in long-term starvation.
Insulin overproduction.
-------------------------
       A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) can cause you to produce too much insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors also can result in too much production of insulin-like substances. Unusual cells of the pancreas that produce insulin can result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia.
Hormone deficiencies.
-----------------------
        Certain adrenal gland and pituitary tumor disorders can result in an inadequate amount of certain hormones that regulate glucose production or metabolism. Children can have hypoglycemia if they have too little growth hormone
